Suite House
=============

Proposed Modules
------------------
- Finance
- Members
- Tasks/Chores
- Administration (part of members?)

General Idea of SuiteHouse
-----------------
Group of applications related to running a house effectively. A User can 'join' a single house that they live at, all the members of the house can see the tasks that the house needs (like cleaning the kitchen or vacuuming or what have you), and these can be assigned to each user. User's can also see the bills that the house needs paid (aggregate on the financial module perhaps, or have the rent bill configured by the admin (landlord) of the house and have it split accross and automatically feed into the financial module). Bills can be individual or HouseWide and each member is only able to see their own finances (besides a possible overall house bills view that would aggregate costs for specific things like rent, water, heat, etc).
