Suite House - Finance Module
=============

In development currently.

Plans and Structure
---------
- Wishlist
 - Simple Collector of amounts and names (no date informaiton neccesary)
- Checkbook
 - Keep track of variable incomes and expenses
- Bills
 - Keep track of fixed expenses that must be paid
 - Feeds into another part of the application (not yet built) that will display bills to the people in the house
- Budgeteer
 - Budgetting program that takes the other 3 into consideration and attempts to come up with a schedule budget combination for a user to use based on their financial situation

The homepage is currently just a menu to select each application, once each application is built I'd like to bring totals information or upcoming bills onto the homepage for easy access by the user
